## Introduction
Zionism As Separatism is a musical event organized by
Clegg & Guttmann in conjunction with their exhibition in the Kunsthalle
Basel. The event will take place on the evening of June 13th in the
reading room of the library of the Basel University. The visitors will
be invited to wander in the reading area or to sit down and to listen to
a team of actors who will read aloud from texts on the topic of Zionism
As Separatism which Clegg & Guttmann gathered and placed on various
shelves in the reading room.

## The general conception of the evening
 The evening is an attempt to
interpret Zionism in a new way: to present Zionism, as it was developed
100 years ago, as an example of separatism. Zionism originated from a
renewed sense of Jewish identity. Many young European Jews who reflected
on the new wave of antisemitism began to believe that assimilation was
impossible. Their conclusion was that the only way for Jews to survive
was to leave Europe and establish a new country. In many ways, Zionism
is a precursor of the politics of identity which is typical of our
period. Today, various social groups experience a combination of a new
sense of identity and a deep alienation from the prevailing norms and
morals. This basic pattern, which combines Utopianism and pessimism, is
what characterize the separatist sensibility. This perspective on
Zionism and other related sensibilities is the central theme of the
evening.

## The organization of the evening 
The reading will last for
approximately 90 minutes. During that time ten readers who will stand in
various locations in the reading room, select reading material from the
designated shelves and read it aloud. The audience will be able to walk
through the locations and stop at each one for a while to listen to the
readers. As the listeners are walking through the library, the voices of
the various readers will be interwoven into one another, combining into
a chance musical composition which will be determined by the route
chosen by the listeners.

## Instructions to the readers
The readers will be instructed to stand
near the designated shelves, choose a book or a publication from their
shelves, read from it aloud for a while and then select another text.
The criterion for the choice of reading material from the designated
shelf and the duration of the reading from each text will be decided by
the readers. It may reflect their interests or, alternatively, it can be
a completely random choice.

## The reading material
The reading material gathered in the various
shelves will include literature on Zionism and other separatist
movements. There will be books and articles on black separatism, gay
separatism and feminist separatism. In addition there will be reading
material about various political ideologies related to separatism. For
example, books about anarchism and about various secessionist movements
will be included as well. What all these movements have in common is a
strong sense of alienation, a willingness to turn away from the existing
society and to start a new society. Some of these efforts lead to
migration. Others center on civil disobedience. And others still
advocate ignoring the law and refusing to participate in the political
process. We hope that this new perspective will contribute to our
understanding of Zionism and other separatist movements.
