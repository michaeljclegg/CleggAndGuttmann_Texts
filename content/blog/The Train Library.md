## Introduction
The main objective of this proposal is to introduce the idea of a train-library and to give a rough description of our ideas concerning its design and realization.

## Basic concept
The fundamental concept of the project is the design of a library-car to be used by the train passengers, they could borrow books and read them while on board the train. The selection of the books and their organization will reflect the particular route of the train. The passengers,  will read about the places to which they travel and learn about the history of the representation or those locals. The passengers could also supplement the reading experience with direct observation of the landscape.

## The design of the library
We propose to house the books in a cabinet that will be placed in the middle of the train compartment, surrounded by small reading tables and chairs. The compartment should be reminiscent of a library and not a "moving living room". The tables should be placed near the windows so that one could easily glance outside while reading.
